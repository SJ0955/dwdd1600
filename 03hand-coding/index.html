            <h2>What is Bigfoot?</h2>
            <p> 
                "Bigfoot, also commonly referred to as Sasquatch, is a large and hairy human-like mythical creature purported to inhabit
                forests in North America, particularly in the Pacific Northwest.""
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bigfoot" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SOURCE</a> <br>
                Descriptions of Bigfoot typically portray it as a large, ape-like or humanoid creature
                covered in hair, with a height ranging from 7 to 10 feet or more. It is known for leaving behind footprints that are
                much larger than those of a typical human, which has contributed to its name.
            </p>

                <li>Skunk Ape</li>
                <li>Yeti</li>

            </ul>

            <h2>Importance of Bigfoot</h2>
            <p>
                In the modern day, we like to think that we know almost everything about our home among the stars. We think that there
                is nothing left to discover; that the age of exploration is over. But what if were wrong? What if there is something
                else out there? A mystery yet to be solved, An animal yet to classified, and a Bigfoot yet to found. The yearning for
                adventure is all still there. You feel it too, don't you?
            </p>

            <p>
                In his article "Why Do So Many People Still Want to Believe in Bigfoot?", Ben Crair from the Smithsonian Magazine
                explains why Bigfoot is so important to us, Americans. He writes:
            </p>

            <p>
                "The hunt for Bigfoot emulates an earlier mode of discovery, when new knowledge was not the product of advanced degrees
                and expensive machinery but rather curiosity, bravery, patience and survival. In the 19th century, the American
                landscape revealed its majesties to ordinary settlers pushing westward into territory unmapped by Europeans. To track
                Bigfoot today is to channel that frontier spirit."

            <h2>Myth or Reality?</h2>
            <p> 
                It's a heated debate between Bigfoot believers and the science community in America and Canada. While many videos and
                stories come out about the creature each year, critics cry the classic refrain that said videos and stories are nothing
                more than elaborate hoaxes. Do they have proof that this is the case? Or are they just denying the clear cut evidence
                before their very eyes; unable to set aside their pride and admit they are wrong. Who is to say? There are still new
                things being discovered to this day in the rainforest of the Amazon and other places around the world. Who is to say
                that the same might not be true for North America and these rumors of Bigfoot?
